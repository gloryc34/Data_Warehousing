# Data_Warehousing
Github dedicated to Data Warehousing class.

The dataset that was used for the following assignments was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/data-science-salaries) ​

I collected the data from Kaggle. The author collected the data from [AI Jobs](https://ai-jobs.net/)

I extracted it to Jupyter Notebook for exploration.

R programming was used to clean the data. Ways that were used to check and clean the data involves missing data and duplicate data. Any missing data was deleted. For this case, there were duplicate rows, but that is fine due to positions having the same salary and attributes.

What are the units of the numeric data?​

What were the formulas used in column creation?​

How is the data validated to ensure consistency?​

What are the definitions for the column names? Include all columns in your dataset.​

If there are set variable options in your dataset, what are thier definitions? ​

What are the regulations to using the data?

If you are referencing sources, be sure to include citations/references as needed.
