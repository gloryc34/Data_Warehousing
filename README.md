# Data_Warehousing
Github dedicated to Data Warehousing class.

The dataset that was used for the following assignments was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/data-science-salaries).I collected the data from Kaggle. The author collected the data from [AI Jobs](https://ai-jobs.net/).I extracted it to Jupyter Notebook for exploration.R programming was used to clean the data. Ways that were used to check and clean the data involves missing data and duplicate data. Any missing data was deleted. For this case, there were duplicate rows, but that is fine due to positions having the same salary and attributes. The columns with numeric data were all integers. On Kaggle, the dataset that was uploaded with given a usability rating of a 10.0, which proves to be reliable and accurate.
